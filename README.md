# amsim

amsim is a CLI tool for efficient, flexible forward-time simulation of
assortative mating and participation/ascertainment effects. It supports arbitary
multivariate assortment regimes and a highly configurable sampling suite for
simulating various genetic study designs.

amsim is free software, licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.

## Installation

### Option A: download a prebuilt binary (recommended)

Prebuilt binaries for Linux (x86_64, arm64) and macOS (x86_64, arm64) are
attached to every [release](https://github.com/lvthnn/amsim/releases).
Dependencies are linked statically or built directly into the binary, so no
installation aside from the binary is required.

To install amsim, grab the appropriate filename for your platform (e.g.
`amsim-v0.2.0-macos-arm64.tar.gz`) from the
[latest release page](https://github.com/lvthnn/amsim/releases/latest).

### Option B: build from source

### Prerequisites

- CMake >= 3.20
- A C++20 compiler (tested with recent Clang and GCC)
- BLAS and LAPACK (on macOS, Apple's Accelerate framework is used automatically;
  on Linux, install e.g. OpenBLAS: `apt install libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev`
  or equivalent)
- HDF5 with C bindings (`apt install libhdf5-dev`, `brew install hdf5`, or
  equivalent)

Linux and macOS are supported natively. Windows is not currently natively
supported, although you can use WSL.

### Building

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lvthnn/amsim.git
cd amsim
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel
```

This may take some time.

## Usage

amsim is driven entirely through command-line flags. Every flag has detailed,
example-driven documentation built in:

```sh
amsim --help                  # display help message + exit
amsim --help --n-individuals  # usage string for specific option(s)
```
